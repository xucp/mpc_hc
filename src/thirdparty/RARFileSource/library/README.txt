Building from source
--------------------

Building RARFileSource requires Visual Studio 2010, the DirectShow SDK and the
DirectShow Base Classes.

The DirectShow SDK and Base Classes are part of the Windows SDK, which can be
found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924.aspx

Instructions on how to build and use the Base Classes can be found here:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms783325(VS.85).aspx


With the prerequisites in place just load and build the RARFileSource.sln
solution.

Happy hacking! Don't forget to submit patches! :)

P.S.

No. I don't have time to answer questions about how to get the SDK and Base
Classes installed and working.
