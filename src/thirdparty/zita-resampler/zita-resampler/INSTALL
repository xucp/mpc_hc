Dependencies
------------

The zita-resampler library does not depend on any
non-standard libraries.

The 'zresample' and 'zretune' application depend on libsndfile
and the corresponding headers.

Installing the library
----------------------

To make and install the library, cd to the libs directory,
make, sudo make install. This will install the lib and
header file in /usr/lib and /usr/include. To install in
any other directory, modify the definition of 'PREFIX' in
the Makefile.
After the install you can do a 'make clean' to return the
libs directory to its original state.


Installing the application(s)
----------------------------

To make and install the application(s), you first need to
make and install the library. Then cd to the apps directory,
make, sudo make install. This will install the apps in
/usr/local/bin. To install in other any directory, modify
the definition of 'PREFIX' in the Makefile.
After the install you can do a 'make clean' to return the
apps directory to its original state.
